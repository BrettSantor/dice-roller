## Description

What started as a single dice roller to get a crash course in web development has grown into a full fledged table top RPG dice rolling app. It now has many features including modifiers, multiple dice rolls at once and a chance to flip a gold coin.

## Installation

## Usage

You can roll a single dice or coin by clicking on the corresponding pictures. You may also roll multiple dice or add modifiers to the first roll by clicking on the plus button and entering how many dice, which kind of dice or coin and what your modifier is.

## Credits

I used JavaScript Simple Dice Roller by Jacob Schaefer as inspiration for this application.
